# Amazon Sales Analysis using SQL Project 

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Amazon Sales Analysis  
**Database**: `Amazon_DB`

This project demonstrates the implementation of Amazon Sales Analysis using SQL.This project focuses on designing and managing a comprehensive relational database system for Amazon-like e-commerce services. The implementation includes creating normalized tables, establishing relationships through primary and foreign keys, and enforcing referential integrity. Additionally, the project demonstrates advanced SQL query techniques to perform detailed analytical tasks, such as sales analysis, customer behavior studies, product profitability assessments, and operational efficiency evaluations. These exercises aim to enhance database design, manipulation, and querying expertise while solving real-world business problems through structured data insights. 

## Objectives

1. **Efficient Database Design**: Create a normalized schema with well-defined primary and foreign key relationships for maintaining data integrity.
2. **Data Analysis**: Perform advanced SQL queries to analyze sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.
3. **Operational Insights**: Generate actionable insights to monitor inventory, seller activity, and shipping performance.
4. **Business Decision Support**: Enable informed decision-making by providing key metrics like revenue, order success rates, and payment trends.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup
![ERD](https://github.com/Parshwa1504/Amazon-Sales-Analysis-Using-SQL/blob/main/Amazon_ERD.png)

- **Database Creation**: Created a database named `Amazon_DB`.
- **Table Creation**: Created tables for category, products, customers, order_items, sellers, shipping, payments, inventory, orders . Each table includes relevant columns and relationships.

```sql
CREATE TABLE category(
	category_id	INT PRIMARY KEY,
	category_name VARCHAR(25)
); 

CREATE TABLE products(
	product_id INT PRIMARY KEY ,
	product_name VARCHAR(50),
	price FLOAT ,	
	cogs FLOAT,
	category_id INT --FK
); 

CREATE TABLE customers(
	Customer_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
	first_name VARCHAR(25),	
	last_name VARCHAR(25),
	Customer_state VARCHAR(25),
	address VARCHAR(25) DEFAULT ('xxxxx')
); 

CREATE TABLE order_items (
    order_item_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT, --FK
    product_id INT, --FK
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT
);


CREATE TABLE sellers (
	seller_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	seller_name VARCHAR(25),
	origin VARCHAR(25)
); 

CREATE TABLE shipping(
	shipping_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	order_id INT, --FK
	shipping_date DATE,
	return_date DATE,
	shipping_providers VARCHAR(25),
	delivery_status VARCHAR(25)
); 

CREATE TABLE payments(
	payment_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	order_id INT, --FK
	payment_date DATE,
	payment_status VARCHAR(25)
); 

CREATE TABLE inventory(
	inventory_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	product_id INT, --FK
	stock INT,
	warehouse_id INT,
	last_stock_date DATE 
); 

CREATE TABLE orders(
	order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	order_date DATE,
	customer_id INT, --FK
	seller_id INT,--FK
	order_status VARCHAR(25)
); 

-- Adding FOREIGN KEY TO TABLES : 

ALTER TABLE orders
ADD FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(Customer_ID) ON DELETE CASCADE ;

ALTER TABLE orders
ADD FOREIGN KEY (seller_id) REFERENCES sellers(seller_id) ON DELETE CASCADE ;

ALTER TABLE inventory 
ADD FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id) ON DELETE CASCADE ;

ALTER TABLE payments
ADD FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id) ON DELETE CASCADE ;

ALTER TABLE shipping
ADD FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id) ON DELETE CASCADE ;

ALTER TABLE products
ADD FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES category(category_id) ON DELETE CASCADE ;

ALTER TABLE order_items
ADD FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id) ON DELETE CASCADE ;

ALTER TABLE order_items
ADD FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id) ON DELETE CASCADE ;

```

### 2. ANALYSIS AND SOLVING ANALYTICAL PROBLEMS RELATED TO AMAZON DATASET :

Challenge: Include the total sales for that category within each state.** 

**Task 7:Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)
Calculate the total value of orders placed by each customer over their lifetime.
Challenge: Rank customers based on their CLTV.**:

**Task 8: Inventory Stock Alerts
Query products with stock levels below a certain threshold (e.g., less than 10 units).
Challenge: Include last restock date and warehouse information.**:

**Task 9:Shipping Delays
Identify orders where the shipping date is later than 3 days after the order date.
Challenge: Include customer, order details, and delivery provider.**:

**Task 10: Payment Success Rate 
Calculate the percentage of successful payments across all orders.
Challenge: Include breakdowns by payment status (e.g., failed, pending).**:

**Task 11: Top Performing Sellers
Find the top 5 sellers based on total sales value.
Challenge: Include both successful and failed orders, and display their percentage of successful orders.**:

**Task 16: IDENTITY customers into returning or new
if the customer has done more than 5 return categorize them as returning otherwise new
Challenge: List customers id, name, total orders, total returns**

**Task 20: Top 10 product with highest decreasing revenue ratio compare to last year(2022) and current_year(2023)**

Challenge: Return product_id, product_name, category_name, 2022 revenue and 2023 revenue decrease ratio at end Round the result
Note: Decrease ratio = cr-ls/ls* 100 (cs = current_year ls=last_year)

**Final Task**

Store Procedure
create a function as soon as the product is sold the the same quantity should reduced from inventory table
after adding any sales records it should update the stock in the inventory table based on the product and qty purchased
